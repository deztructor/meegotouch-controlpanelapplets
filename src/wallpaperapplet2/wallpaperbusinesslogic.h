 A little help abou the wallpaper GConf settings. Here is how the GConf database
 should look like:

 /desktop/meego/background/portrait:
  history = [/home/pipas/MyDocs/.wallpapers/100_0052.JPG,/home/pipas/MyDocs/.wallpapers/100_0051.JPG,/home/pipas/MyDocs/.wallpapers/100_0041.JPG,/home/pipas/MyDocs/.wallpapers/DSC05181.JPG,/home/pipas/MyDocs/.wallpapers/100_0037.JPG,/home/pipas/MyDocs/.wallpapers/DSCF2029.JPG,/home/pipas/MyDocs/.wallpapers/100_0039.JPG,/home/pipas/MyDocs/.wallpapers/100_0044.JPG,/home/pipas/MyDocs/.wallpapers/100_0038.JPG,/home/pipas/MyDocs/.wallpapers/100_0043.JPG]
  picture_filename = /home/pipas/.wallpapers/100_0052.png
  original_filename = [/home/pipas/.wallpapers/100_0052.png,/home/pipas/MyDocs/.wallpapers/100_0052.JPG]

 (1) /desktop/meego/background/portrait/picture_filename

     The full path of the current portrait wallpaper image or the logical name
     of the theme image if a theme file is used. The path always starts with 
     '/', the logical ID is never.

     This value is used by any package that needs to get the portrait wallpaper 
     image.

 (2) /desktop/meego/background/portrait/original_filename

     A string list that contains exactly two values, the current portrait
     wallpaper image path (the same as in 1.) and the original image path that
     was used as image source when the wallpaper image was set.

     The wallpaper applet uses this value to find the original image file, so
     that the list view of the wallpaper applet will never show both the
     original image file and the current value. The current wallpaper image is
     usually a slightly modified (or not modified at all) version of some
     "original file" and apparently showing both images is a very bad user 
     experience.

     This GConf key holds both the original and the current value and if some
     application is setting only the current wallpaper key (as in 1.) the
     wallpaper applet will ignore the original image value. This is an important
     protection.

     All application that sets the portrait wallpaper should also set this
     value.

 (3) /desktop/meego/background/portrait/history

     The wallpaper applet shows the available wallpapers in the order of the
     "history", a backward timeline of modifications. This list contains the
     last 10 wallpapers, the most recently used (current) at first, then the
     previous wallpaper, and so on.

     The applications that change the wallpaper should always add the original 
     file path to the beginning of the list (or move this value to the first
     place if it is already in the list) and truncate the list so that it
     contains 10 items at max.
